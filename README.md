# Blog-Application-In-Asp.Net-MVC
This is a .Net MVC project gor log application.
In this project, you could have the option for register, login and logout option.
In ths project, the authentication and authorization is working well.
It means that you can not access the details without logging in.
And you can not access someone else's account.
There will be two roles given on that i.e., Admin and User.
You can only signup for User account, for admin you have to insert that with the code itself.
In this project, the admin will be able to see all the blogs which people created and have the power to disable and again enable it for everyone.
User can see his/her seperate blog also and can manipulate them.
